  |   Australia is known for its relatively low population density and vast, sparsely populated areas.     |
  |   The country has a well-developed infrastructure and resources that support its population.           |
  |   However, there are ongoing discussions about the environmental impact, resource management, and      | 
  |   urbanization challenges, particularly in major cities. Overall, Australia is not considered          | 
  |  overpopulated, but there are localized concerns and discussions regarding sustainableÂ development.    |
