    |    China has historically been concerned about overpopulation, which led to the implementation of policies      |
    |    to control population growth. The one-child policy, introduced in 1979, aimed to curb population growth.     | 
    |                   However, it was relaxed and replaced with a two-child policy in 2015.                         |
