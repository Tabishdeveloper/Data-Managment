    |==========================================================================================================|
    |  India faces significant challenges related to overpopulation, including high population density,        |
    |    resource strain, and pressure on infrastructure. The country has implemented various family planning  |
    |    initiatives to control population growth. Overpopulation has implications for issues such as poverty, |
    |    unemployment, and strain on healthcare and educational systems. Efforts to address these challenges   |
    |       include promoting family planning, education, and economicÂ development.                            |
